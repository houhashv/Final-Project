% Function: best_mixture_model(mixtures)
%
% Determines the best mixture model out of a matrix of structures (each of
% which contains a mixture, a corresponding icl value, and a flag that 
% denotes whether or not the mixture has too much structure). The best 
% mixture model is the model with the lowest icl value, and does not have 
% too much structure. 
%
% param[in] mixtures: A matrix of structures.
% param[out] mbest: The best mixture model.
% param[out] iclbest: The icl value of the best mixture model.
