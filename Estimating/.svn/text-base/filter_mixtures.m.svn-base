% Function: filter_mixtures(mixtures, lambda)
% 
% Filters the specified matrix of structures. Each structure has a .mixture 
% and .icl field. This function adds a .mixed_p field to each structure. If 
% mixed_p is 1, then the mixture does not have too much structure. If 
% is 0, then the mixture has too much structure, and if mixed_p is NaN, the
% .mixture field is NaN. A mixture has too much structure if the maximum 
% weight is greater than lambda times the minimum weight. 
%
% param[in] mixtures: A matrix of structures.
% param[in] lambda: The allowable max to min weight ratio.
% param[out] mixtures: The original set of structures with the .mixed_p
% field added.
