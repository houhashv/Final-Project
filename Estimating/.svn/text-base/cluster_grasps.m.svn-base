% Function: cluster_grasps(m, micl, train_pts, valid_pts, nsteps, nattempts)
%
% Learns the parameters of the supplied mixture model m using the samples
% in train_pts. The EM algorithm is used to set the parameters and weights
% of each component distribution in m. The EM algorithm is performed 
% nattempts times (each taking nsteps steps), and the mixture with the
% best ICL value on the validation set valid_pts is returned.
%
% param[in] m: A mixture distribution object.
% param[in] micl: The icl value for m.
% param[in] train_pts: A matrix of training samples (each a column vector)
% param[in] valid_pts: A matrix of validation samples (each a column vector)
% param[in] nsteps: The number of EM steps performed.
% param[in] nattempts: The number of times the EM algorithm is performed.
% param[out] mbest: The best mixture model according to the ICL criterion.
% param[out] iclbest: The icl value of mbest.
